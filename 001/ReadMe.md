# Day One - Microsoft C# Func<TResult> Delegate

  ### What are Delegates?
  
  A delegate is a type that represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type. When you instantiate a delegate, you can associate its instance with   any method with a compatible signature and return type
  
  ### Func<TResult> Delegate
  ```c#
  public delegate TResult Func<out TResult>();
  ```
  
  Encapsulates a method that has no parameters and returns a value of the type specified by the TResult parameter. Delegate are popularly called callbacks, first order functions     and etc in some other programming languages. They simply help to stand as anonymous function without explicitly being defined. We can used them to notify a task as a predicate.   Delegate Func<TResult> can stand out as argument which enables writing of more organized code. 
  
  ### Example - 01
  ```c#
    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using System.Linq;

    namespace ConsoleApp
    {
        public class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                string[] months = { "january", "february", "march", "april", "may", "june", "july", "august", "september", "october", "november", "december" };

                Func<string, string> selector = str => str.ToUpper();

                IEnumerable<string> capitalizedMonths = months.Select(selector);

                foreach (var month in capitalizedMonths)
                {
                    System.Console.WriteLine(month);
                }
            }
        }
    }
  ```
